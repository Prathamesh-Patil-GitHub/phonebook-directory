# phonebook-directory
This is a simple program written in Java language for handling contact details.
It follows OOP (Object Oriented Programming) approach to solve the problem. The program lets you- 1) Manage a Personal Phonebook Directory which Adds Contacts with their Name and Phone Number. 2) Search for a contact added in the contact list. 3) Remove particular contacts from the Contact List. 4) Watch the complete Contact List at once.
In this program, we have used TreeMap to store Name and Phone number jointly.
It uses ObjectOutputStream to store the data in a persistent file which is stored in the users home directory.
It also uses ObjectInputStream to read the information from the file which is used in the program.
It also uses Vector wrapper class for saving multiple records at once in the file.
